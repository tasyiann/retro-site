          <h3>What is Open Graph?</h3>
          <p>Open Graph is a protocol which transforms web pages into graph objects
            in a social graph. This can be done by placing Open Graph meta tags in the head of a
            webpage.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I make use of it?</h3>
          <p>I have used the basic Metadata which are:
            <xmp>
                "og:title"
                "og:type"
                "og:url"
                "og:image"
                "og:description"
            </xmp>
          </p>

          <h3>What is humans.txt?</h3>
          <p>It is a txt file that contains information about the people who have
            contributed to build the website.
          </p>
          <h3>How have I configure it for my site?</h3>
          <p>Since my team is <em>literally me</em>, my humans.txt file looks like this:</p>
           <xmp>
              /* TEAM */
              Chef: Anastasios Yiannakidis
              Twitter: [ [ a t ] ] y i a n n a k i d e s

          <div class="post_info"> Posted by Anastasios, <time datetime="2017-09-09">2017-09-10</time></div>
        <h3>What is robots.txt?</h3>
        <p>The robots.txt file belongs to the REP (robots exclusion protocol) which is a group of web standards. 
          These web standards show how robots can crawl the web and access information.
          The robots.txt files, let the web crawlers (user agents) to know which parts of the website are allowed
          to crawl, and which parts are not.
        </p>
        <h3>How have I configure it for my site?</h3>
        <p>Following the instructions of the assignment, I disallow the access to contact me page,
          from all web crawlers. Also, following my instinct, I disallow also the access to all .jpeg images.
          <xmp>
              User-agent:*
              Disallow: /pages/contact.html
              Disallow: /*.jpg$
          </xmp>

          <div class="post_info"> Posted by Anastasios, <time datetime="2017-09-09">2017-09-09</time></div>
          <h3>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css)
            from content (html)?
          </h3>  
          <p>One of the reasons is to avoid confusing
            the purpose of their usage. Htlm should be semantic and css should
            make the styling. In addition, keeping them in seperate files, is easier
            to maintain and to debug.</p>

        <h2>BONUS - Trip to China</h2>
        <div class="post_info"> Posted by Anastasios, <time datetime="2017-09-09">2017-09-08</time></div>
        <p>A <em>unique</em> experience.<br> Thanks to Confucius Institute,
          I did not just travel to China. I experienced the <em>Chinese culture</em>,
          that I have always admire. The summer camp was way beyond my expectations.
          We saw and experience as much as we could in just two weeks.
          Despite the fact I was amazed by the tall buildings and the <em>modern</em> architecture,
          I also loved the <em>traditional</em> streets, the Hutongs. <br>It is really impressive how,
          the modern life and the traditional life blends together.</p>
